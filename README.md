Mealify


This app is called Mealify! Mealify's purpose is to aid in finding recipes and ingredients for those recipes while also informing people about the nutritional value in these recipes and ingredients. 

Functionalities: 

1. Users can create a "lunchbox" for the day to store the day's meals and food products eaten
2. Users can search for recipes or individual ingredients/food products and add them to their lunchbox
3. In the "Goals" section of the app, users can log the protein and calories they have in their lunchbox, or even any calories or protein that aren't in the lunchbox.
4. Users can also use the 2 sliders to set protein and calorie goals for the day, and when their logged amounts match the goals set, they will receive a congratulations message!

Challenges in building:

I had a bit of trouble in figuring out JSON decoding and making API requests
Animations were tricky to do!!

Future additions:

I would improve the UI more to make it more appealing and have a more uniform theme
For the goal tracker, I want the app to be able to automatically log the protein and calories in the lunchbox and be able to track their goals daily
